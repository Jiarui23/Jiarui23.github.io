While human oversight and critical thinking remain essential to catch inaccuracies and tailor outputs, GenAI stands as a powerful collaborator for both academic projects and future professional tasks. However, it comes with issues which I have to watch out for. I have to be careful when using it and not rely on it too much, understanding the topic and the code it generates. I also have to make sure that I do not use it for everything, as this will make me lazy and not learn anything."
